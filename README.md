## Web application structure

**Web Application Structure**

![alt text](https://github.com/XinwuWang/2023S2-BRMM-webapp/blob/main/readme_images/webapp%20srtucture.jpg "webapp structure")

My web application has totally 15 routes, 14 templates, 6 provided course images, and 4 background images from other sources. There are 6 routes and 6 templates for the public interface, while 9 routes and 8 templates for the admin interface.

The routes, templates, database, and static files interact with each other to realise all the functionalities required by COMP636 Motorkhana final assignment.
